# What is Front-end?
Frontend refers to the part of a web application or website that users interact with directly. It includes the user interface (UI), the design, and the functionality that users see and interact with in their web browser.

The frontend is built using languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used to create the structure of the web page, CSS is used for styling and layout, and JavaScript is used for dynamic functionality such as interactivity, animations, and client-side data validation.

A frontend developer is responsible for designing, developing, and testing the user interface of a website or web application. They work closely with designers and backend developers to ensure that the frontend and backend components of the application are integrated seamlessly and function correctly.

A well-designed frontend is critical for creating a positive user experience, which can lead to increased user engagement and retention. A frontend that is visually appealing, easy to use, and responsive can make a significant difference in the success of a web application or website.
